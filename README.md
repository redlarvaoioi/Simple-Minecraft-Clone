# Simple-Minecraft-Clone
Simple Minecraft a clone written in react (the assets are from my friend (bro uses rosebud cuz he's so bad)). It has a one chunk loaded, and you can look around and move. 
I used ThreeJs and some other stuff. Feel free to use this code, just make sure to leave a star and credit me (a simple "original code from redlarvaoioi" will do)! :)
